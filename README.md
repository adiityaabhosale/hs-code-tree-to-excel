# hs-code-tree-to-excel
Python script to fetch and structure Harmonized System (HS) codes into a hierarchical tree format and export them to an Excel file with clear indentation and descriptions.
This Python project fetches the latest Harmonized System (HS) tariff codes from the WCO website or a trusted public source and structures them into a hierarchical tree format: Chapter (HS-2), Heading (HS-4), and Subheading (HS-6). The script then exports this structured data to an Excel file, using column indentation or grouping to visually represent the tree hierarchy. The Excel output includes clear formatting with proper descriptions for each level of the HS code. Optionally, a flattened view (with Section, HS Code, and Description) can also be included in a separate sheet. The project uses requests and BeautifulSoup for web scraping, pandas for data handling, and openpyxl or xlsxwriter for Excel export. This tool is useful for customs professionals, logistics teams, data analysts, and anyone needing to analyze or present HS code data in a readable format.
